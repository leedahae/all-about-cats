<p>Com is a 5-year-old Korean shot-hair male, Dal is a 3-year-old Turkish Angora female, and I am still a servant who is learning about cats. 
The charming Com with a chubby-bellied likes to knead in my arms, an sharp Dal that often sets its claws. Dal like to hold their servants. They make me spend money and hurt my wrist.</p>

<h2 id="the-beginning-of-a-cats-servants-life">the beginning of a cats servantâ€™s life.</h2>

<p>I just wanted to raise a cat without any hesitation, but there were so many things I didnâ€™t know that I just cried when I took the cat to the hospital for the first time. Thinking that I didnâ€™t know it must have hurt, I cried more when I saw the details of the card that was paid. I raised the animal for the first time, and I knew that it cost me so much money.
Raising a life was a way of realizing that you should never start without preparation.</p>

<p>This blog was created in the hope of reducing the trials and errors that I experienced. :D
I will give all the information about cats to the servants of the cat.</p>
