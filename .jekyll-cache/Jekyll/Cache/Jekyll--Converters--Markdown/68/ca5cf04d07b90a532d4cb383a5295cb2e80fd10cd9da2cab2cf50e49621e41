I"D<p>Cats tend to vomit more easily than other animals. Even a healthy child, it is normal to throw up a hairball once or twice a month. Cats naturally swallow their own fur as they grooming, some of which are excreted by feces, but some remain in the digestive tract to vomit.
However, if you have a lot of vomit or are repetitive or sustained, you may need to see a cause. From now on, let’s learn about the cause of cat vomiting!</p>

<h3 id="in-a-hurry-to-feed-eat">In a hurry to feed eat</h3>

<p><img src="\img\post\05\01.jpg" alt="vomit" /></p>

<p>Usually, when a cat spits something, it is thought that it vomits. Eating and vomiting fast is not a general vomiting but a discharge.  A discharge is a form in which the contents are not digested and come back out. If the form of the feed remains almost intact or vomits not long after it has been eaten, it is highly likely that it is discharge.
If this is the cause of vomiting, you should help them eat their food slowly. Also, we need to think about why cats eat in a hurry, and some cats have urgent personalities, but they can eat in a hurry even if they give food late or in small amounts. Check to see if the cat is giving enough food to fit its weight! Rather than giving a lot of food at once, divide it up frequently and put it in  :)</p>

<p>If cat throw up after eating your food in a hurry, you don’t have to go to the animal hospital immediately. However, if the number is too high, more than five times a week, or accompanied by a lack of appetite and weight loss, you need to make sure there is no problem elsewhere.</p>

<p>Similar symptoms may occur in esophageal diverticulum, macrophobia, and esophageal exercise. Please be careful because vomiting too often can lead to secondary outbreaks of diseases such as reflux esophagitis or gastritis!</p>

<h3 id="dietary-allergy">Dietary allergy</h3>

<p>Dietary allergies usually show digestive symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea. In addition, you can also see hair loss and skin problems. If you’re a cat that didn’t vomit and you suddenly get nausea and don’t have any particular abnormalities in your organs, you might be suspicious of dietary allergies.
Also, think about whether there was a event related to when the cat was throwing up. For example, you either gave cat a new snack or if you throw up after you change your feed, you can think of an allergy to that food ingredient.</p>

<p>In case of dietary allergies, vomiting is alleviated by giving food given by hospitals or feed with a single protein source. If the symptoms are too severe, you may also use a antiemetic drug or gastrointestinal medicine to relieve allergies.</p>

<h3 id="hairball">Hairball</h3>

<p><img src="\img\post\05\03.jpg" alt="vomit" /></p>

<p>I’ve just told you a little This is one of the most common causes of cat vomiting. hairball is that lumps together and vomits.
Usually known about once a month, it can vary depending on the length of a cat’s fur, environment, etc. For example, a long-haired cat can have a little more frequent hairballs because it has a lot of hair.
After throwing up your hairball, you may experience a slight loss of appetite, but it’s not a major problem. However, if cat loss of appetite lasts for more than 24 hours, you should suspect something other than a hairball!</p>

<p>If you want to prevent hairball vomiting, combing your cat’s hair often and providing it with nutrients can help. Also, giving cat skin nutrients such as terra-coats and omega-3s can be a way to prevent hairball.
Eating fiber is also known to help release hairballs. Hairball generally doesn’t have a big problem, but sometimes it causes a rare problem. 
Shouldn’t be reassured that it usually resembles hairball vomiting. Please check for any other symptoms with this!</p>

<h3 id="ingestion-of-foreign-substances">Ingestion of foreign substances</h3>

<p><img src="\img\post\05\02.jpg" alt="vomit" /></p>

<p>Cats are so curious that they can unwittingly eat toys, threads, and so on. In particular, the linear foreign body can cause intestinal hypertrophy, intestinal obstruction, and even peritoneal inflammation and sepsis.
Toys or items that a cat can normally put in its mouth should be kept out of reach of the cat! In the case of toys, it’s also a good behavioristic way to play and store them in a place where the cat can’t see them. :)</p>

<p>Usually when you eat foreign substances, your appetite and vitality are often reduced with vomiting. 
If a foreign object is on stomach, it can be removed endoscopically, but since you need to have an open operation when you are in the bowel over time, it is best to go to the hospital quickly if you have seen eating or suspected foreign substances!</p>

<h3 id="other-diseases">other diseases</h3>

<p>The causes of cat vomiting vary beyond all description. Examples include pan-white blood cell reduction, toxic substance poisoning, parasites, pancreatitis, diabetes, thyroid disease, kidney disease, malignant tumors, and stomatitis.
That’s why it’s necessary to do some tests to find the cause. Usually, if you’re going to do a radiation test, a blood test, an ultrasound test, etc. Kit inspection, gastrointestinal contrast, endoscopy, PCR, etc. can also be performed as needed.</p>

<p>It is important to know what happened to the cat recently in order to know the cause of the cat vomiting. Also, when you visit an animal hospital, take a picture of the vomit contents and a video of the vomit with you, which can be helpful for your treatment.
You can also think about when a cat vomits, whether it has a characteristic of timing or cycle, how much is it, and how it smells!</p>

<p>For example, if you have a cat that vomits after eating a feed, you might say, “Our cat vomits after 5 to 10 minutes. If you eat feed 3 times, you feel like you vomit 1 times. We haven’t changed our feed lately.” You can explain it this way.</p>
