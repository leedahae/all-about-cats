I"]<p>Do you know how to find out when a cat is sick?
In the case of cats, they are famous for not showing off even if they are sick. If you check the basic health data of a cat, you can not only identify its physical condition but also use it as a basis for judgment if the cat later becomes in bad shape. Therefore, when measuring basic health data, you can reduce errors by checking breathing, heart rate, and weight in this order.
So this time, let’s learn more about how to check the health of cats.</p>

<p>When the cat is comfortable, gently place your hand on the stomach and count the number of chest ups and downs for one minute. If a cat doesn’t wait for that time, you can count for 15 seconds and multiply by 4.
The average respiration rate for healthy cats is 24 to 42 times a minute.</p>

<h3 id="heart-rate">Heart rate</h3>

<p><img src="\img\post\06\02.jpg" alt="check2" /></p>

<p>Heart rate increases when excited or nervous, so it is recommended to measure it for one minute when comfortable. If it is difficult to measure for one minute, you can count for 15 seconds and multiply by 4.
If you put your hands in the cat’s armpit and wrap them around, it’s easier to measure, and the cat’s heart rate is about 120 to 140 times per minute.</p>

<p>Rather than check a cat’s anus, it’s more convenient for cats to take their temperature by putting it in cat ears, which is less stressful for cats and more convenient for cat servants. The normal temperature of a cat is known to be 37.5 to 39 degrees.
Also, if you are aware of the normal temperature of a cat because of frequent skinship, you can easily determine if the cat has a fever when it is in bad condition. They say it’s better to check the temperature of the cat at any time.</p>

<h3 id="weight-check">weight check</h3>

<p><img src="\img\post\06\04.jpg" alt="check4" /></p>

<p>If you weigh a cat at home, there are two ways to measure it, first, a cat servant can hold a cat and measure it.
First, I weigh the cat servant, then I take the cat and weigh it again. And here you can find out the weight of the cat except for your weight.
The second is how to measure a cat by putting it in the carrier. If you know the weight of carrier, you can measure your weight without forcing a cat out of the carrier during a animal hospital visit, which can reduce unnecessary stress.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying to figure out how to check cat’s health.
Don’t you think you should be able to check your cat’s health carefully before it gets sick?
Without simple health data, your cat may not know if it gets a big illness. Remember these health check methods and check your cat’s condition often.</p>
