### cat communication

Cats don't bark like dogs, but they often cry over and over again.
As human beings speak, cats communicate in their own way, but it is very hard to a cat servant if they cry often.
(Of course, there are cats who cannot hear their voices) Especially when they cry early in the morning or in the morning, they experience a lower quality of life.
When I hear them cry over and over again, I think, 'So why the hell are you crying?' I don't know what the cat thinks, but I can try to guess.



### Mating Season

If it is before neutralization, it can cry hard because of sexually excited.
cats cry really, really hard when do something called "calling" to seduce. And in male cats, if you take a piss  or  Sometimes you bend your body round when you hit your butt.
Therefore, it is usually better to neutralize before the sexually excited



### kitten

Usually, when a kitten cries, it's just that the house isn't adapted and it's unfamiliar.
When my cat Dal was a baby, Dal walked one step, cried another, and wept.
Just as humans solve all communication by crying when they are babies, cats cry a lot when they are babies.



### They're asking for attention.

When a large cats cries, it cries when there is something it wants. If you cry even though there is a lot of rice in the rice bowl, It may be for other reasons.
If the cat servant work is so busy that he is negligent of the cat, he or she may cry for attention or play
What if I cry when I've played and cared enough for him? It may be crying because the bathroom is dirty.
Like a little nagging mom. 'Get rid of the bathroom!!!! 'Human!' That's what it feels like.



### Dementia

Old age cats can be suspected of dementia. Cats can get dementia when they get older like humans. If a cat has Alzheimer's,
If you have a somewhat lower understanding and can't keep sleeping or covering your bowels properly, or if you keep crying when your movements are different from normal, you should think about dementia.
Since crying due to dementia occurs a lot at night, it is recommended to increase activity during the daytime so that you can get as much sleep at night as possible.

There are many other reasons besides the above. If a cat just cries and doesn't eat properly, it has to go to the hospital. A cat may be sick.(Even if they don't cry, if you just hides, It may also be painful.)
Before I had a cat, I thought cat wouldn't cry very much, but was crying so many times.
I can't guess 100 percent of the reasons every time I cry, but knowing a few reasons will make it much easier.
