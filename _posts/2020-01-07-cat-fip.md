### Feline Infections Peritonitis(FIP)

Cat FIP is a disease caused by coronavirus.
It's known to be caused by a mutation in the coronavirus.
That's why even cats with coronavirus don't necessarily get FIP.
Usually cat coronavirus cases show mild digestive symptoms when infected.
They often get better without special treatment. There are no results of any special research, but some say that cats that live in homes or on the streets have more than 90 percent of the time.
It's usually transmitted through grooming, toilets. 
Occasionally, symptoms are absent, so the cats owner is often unaware of the infection.
Sometimes did an examination coronavirus kit, a positive reaction comes out and asks if there is a risk of FIP.
but It's a mutant, so it's hard to call it FIP.


FIPV (Feline Infections Peritonitis Virus) is a mutated corona virus.
The virus spreads the macrophages a type of white blood cell as its host, all over the body.
White blood cells play an important role in the immune system. That's why they use immunosuppressants to improve symptoms of cat FIP.
Some people say that excessive stress in cats is a risk factor for FIP.
It's hard to say that there's no basis at all, and stress promotes inflammatory reactions.
That's to say, it's aggravating the immune system.
Of course, it's a human-based study, but mammals such as rats and pigs showed similar reactions.
Since coronavirus is RNA virus that mutates easily, it's hard to say that even cats that don't have FIP don't have mutant virus.
However, if the immune system is healthy, it is assumed that even a small amount of mutagenic viruses pass by without a major problem



#### Cat FIP? Dry type and wet type

FIP has many different symptoms, most of which can be divided into dry and wet foods. The biggest symptom that distinguishes it is whether ascites.
In the early days, most cats experience similar symptoms of dry type and wet type.
It's a high fever that doesn't respond to antibiotics, poor appetite and vitality, and weight loss.
wet type usually progresses faster than dry type.
Dry type can present neurological symptoms.
Other symptoms include jaundice, renal failure, anemia, and the activity of the virus causes a variety of symptoms.
Corona virus is a virus that mutates easily.



#### Is our cat dangerous, too?

So far, it has been known that cats usually occur less than two years, especially between 4 and 12 months.
They are said more likely to appear in environments such as homes or animal shelters where many cats live, which is believed to be related to stress

People ask many questions, "Is our cat a real FIP?"
Diagnosis of FIP is difficult to diagnose correctly, because a biopsy is necessary for a definite diagnosis.
Symptoms often overlap with other diseases. So the diagnosis of FIP is done by excluding other diseases.
Not just one test, but several results are comprehensively determined.
X-rays, blood tests, ultrasound, Elisha kits, and rebalta tests are used.



#### Treatment of cat FIP

Unfortunately, there is no sure cure for cat FIP.
It is known that new drugs are being developed that control immunity or suppress the activity of viruses.
Currently, anti-inflammatory drugs or immunosuppressants, which can relieve symptoms or prolong life, are mainly used as secondary treatments.

A cat FIP vaccine is available on the market, but it is not actively recommended.
So the American Cat Vaccine Commission announced that it wasn't recommended.
The reason is that cats already infected with the corona virus may be less effective or more likely to develop it.
Since most cats are often infected from the birth of the coronavirus, it seems that the inoculation is not active.
Most cats are born with infected the coronavirus from birth, so it seems that they are not actively vaccinated.

#### To the health of the cat

Although prevention is not well known, I think it would be better to reduce the stress of cats.
Especially for a kitten with less than a year.
Also, giving good food and lactobacillus or a comprehensive nutrient to develop immunity is one of the best ways, right?
To reduce stress, it is most important to provide a good environment for cats.
a hideaway for cats to hide and rest, enough vertical space, scratcher their claws, etc.
It's also better if you play hard to satisfy the cat's hunting instincts!
I hope the FIP treatment will be commercialized soon, and I will meet you in the following blog article:)
