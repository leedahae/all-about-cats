description: Cats should not eat anything that people eat. Then, what food can't a cat eat? Let's find out a list of foods that cats can't eat.
---



Cats are known to be animals that rarely show symptoms even when they are sick. This is what I realized after thousands of years of wild life because I found it disadvantageous to expose pain in the face of predators and future partner.
However, it is not a good habit for cats who live in a safe indoor environment. Therefore, a guardian should know about the cat's disease and deal with it in advance. One way cats can prevent pain is by limiting food.
Usually cats are known to not react like dogs to human food, which varies slightly depending on the breed. Therefore, cat owner need to distinguish between what a cat should not eat and what a cat can eat.
So, what foods should cats not eat? Let's learn more about the food that cats shouldn't eat today.



### Food that cats should not eat first "fish"

First of all, if you think about stereotypes, I think cats would like to eat raw fish, but actually it's dangerous to eat it. In fact, raw meat is considered a deadly food because it is likely to cause food poisoning.
This is caused by salmonella bacteria in raw fish, and the enzyme in raw fish destroys thiamin of vitamin B essential for cats, which can cause loss of appetite, seizures, coma and difficulty walking.
The same goes for raw meat, including fish. Therefore, if you want to give raw meat, you have to study a lot and give it with caution.



### The second food a cat should not eat is "grapes and raisins"

grapes cause rapid kidney damage. This includes grape skin, kernel and seeds, all of which contain grapes, raisins, grape seed oil, etc.
If a cat eats grapes, it should be checked to see if it shows diarrhea, vomiting, coma, and exhaustion.
Even if you don't experience any symptoms immediately after eating, grapes contain toxins that can cause kidney failure, which in severe cases can lead to acute renal failure, so if a cat eats grapes, it's better to visit the zoo immediately.



### The third food a cat should not eat is the "bone of meat"

And the third one is the bones of meat. Meat bones can easily get caught in the cat's throat or mouth. In addition, even if ingested without injury, it can damage the internal organs, such as the digestive organs, and should be avoided.
Because cats are carnivores, they prefer meat to vegetables and carbohydrates. In fact, the protein in meat is good for cats' heart, reproductive system and eyesight. But meat with bones must be removed bones and given to cats.



### Food that cats should not eat Fourth "Flower and Plants"

Many people often grow flowers or plants in home. But flowers and plants can be a threat to cats. The toxins in flowers and plants can lead to kidney failure.
In particular, it is recommended not to place the lily, trumpet, chrysanthemum, aloe, etc. near the cat. Plants such as these are subject to liver damage, hallucinations, rashes, etc. and in severe cases, death can occur, and need to be with care.



### The fifth food a cat should not eat is "tuna cans"

Finally, human tuna cans and cat tuna cans are quite different. Human-eating tuna cans are rich in salt and oil. Sometimes when you run into a street cats, you pay for a can of tuna because you feel sorry for cats.
It is better to have chicken breast cans if you don't have food when you meet street cats in an act that harms the cat's health. These days, you can often see snacks for dogs and cats at market. For cat health, check your canned food carefully and have to give!
