### I have two cats. Com and Dal:)

Com is a 5-year-old Korean shot-hair male, Dal is a 3-year-old Turkish Angora female, and I am still a servant who is learning about cats. 
The charming Com with a chubby-bellied likes to knead in my arms, an sharp Dal that often sets its claws. Dal like to hold their servants. They make me spend money and hurt my wrist.



### the beginning of a cats servant's life

![dal](img\post\01\01.jpg)

I just wanted to raise a cat without any hesitation, but there were so many things I didn't know that I just cried when I took the cat to the hospital for the first time. Thinking that I didn't know it must have hurt, I cried more when I saw the details of the card that was paid. I raised the animal for the first time, and I knew that it cost me so much money.
Raising a life was a way of realizing that you should never start without preparation.
